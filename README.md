# Titanic_machine_learning_model
In this project we used few machine learning models to train our training data and found the best suitable model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck
before getting into the model I first analysed the data and used feature selection techniques to filter the data, I used visualization tools to visualize the important features that is going to affect my model strongly.I used few classification models since it is a binary classification problem I used Logistic regression ,Decision tree and random forest tree as our algorithm I used cross validation score to check the performance of my model,sinblem ce its a binary classification problem I choose to use Confusion matrix to check the accuracy of the model, finally we used Bagging alogorithm (Random Forest tree algorithm ) and got the accuracy near about 82.05%
